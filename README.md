Project one: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to possible employers. The portfolio highlights three projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form.

## Demo

## UX

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site with an exciting design. The color scheme was chosen to create a colourful and easily readable design.

For employers, I wanted to provide them with an overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly and
exciting design.

This webpage is my online CV .

 I built this website according to this wireframe.[Link to WF](https://github.com/robibrutoczki/website/blob/master/wireframe.svg "Link to WF")

I wanted to archive few thing over the project:
- to make it visually appealing
- easy navigation
- easy to contact me
- downloadable contents
- links to project

## Features
I used almost everything what I have learned from the course.

####  **Existing Features**

This site uses the scrollspy feature in Bootstrap . In the navbar it shows(green highlight on menu items) whitch section is on show as we scroll up and down on the page.
Added a link to download my CV.
On small screen devices : collapse navbar,when opening and clicking on links it will close itself.

##### **Features Left to Implement**
I would like to add more pages to show projects. Modal to work . 
## Technologies
Used:

- CSS
- Bootstrap 4

### Testing

The page used so many features to show to employers and recruiters what can be achieved by me.  The intention is to show of my work(s). In the about me section, they can read a bit about me, send me a message and download my CV. They are able to see my showcased projects via the project cards in the "Skills" section. They can view the live version of my work by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the contact area. They are also able to download my CV by either clicking on CV in the navbar or by clicking on the download arrow icon in the Contact section.

If you try to submit the contact form it won't work, it will be functional in the near future.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download  on click using the 'Download CV'or CV in the navbar. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are working perfectly.

By clicking on the links in the navbar, the link will take you to the section named on the link. The link will glow green even on click or when you get to that section by scroling down on the page, 

This site was tested across multiple browsers on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized 
some device rendering the CSS in different ways. My Android phone aligned the project cards to the left. After many hours I started to test on other phones and tablets the cards were aligned perfectly . Except on my own.

#### Conclusion : Test your pages with multiple dev tools and devices.
