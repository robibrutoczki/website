Project one: User-Centric Frontend Development - Code Institute

This is my portfolio website to present to possible employers. The portfolio highlights three projects that cover a range of technologies, as well as including a bit about myself, my coding skills, and a contact form.

## UX

------

My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible to access information on the site with an exciting design to impress. The colour scheme was chosen to create a colourful and easily readable design.

For employers, I wanted to provide them with an overview of myself and my capabilities via a user friendly and exciting design.

 I built this website according to this wireframe.[here]( https://github.com/robibrutoczki/website/blob/master/wireframe.svg	"")
I wanted to archive few thing over the project:

- to make it visually appealing
- responsive
- easy navigation
- easy to contact me
- downloadable contents
- links to project

## Features
I used almost everything what I have learned from the course.

####  **Existing Features**

##### **Navbar**
This site uses the scrollSpy feature in Bootstrap . In the navbar it shows(green highlight on menu items) which section is on show as we scroll up and down on the page.
Added a link to download my CV.
On small screen devices : collapse navbar,when opening and clicking on links it will close itself.

##### **Landing** 
I used what i learned from the "whiskey" project.
Made a parallax background.
##### **About**
In here there is 3 columns (on small screens only 2 visible) ,added 2 links to be able the user to download my CV and leave me a message. The buttons are changing colour on hover.
##### **Projects**
There are 3 card showing my project. With links to live pages.
They are see through cards ,become solid on hover.
##### **Features**
To show what technologies I using.
##### **Contacts**
Showing contacts and links to social sites. Links have Fontawesome Icons. Icons are changing colour on hover.
There is a Modal to let user to send me a message .(not live yet.)
I added a up button to the page to go to "home".This will help for users to navigate better.

##### **Features Left to Implement**
I would like to add more pages to show projects. Modal to work . 
## Technologies

- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) : For version control.

-  [Github]( https://github.com/	""): To deploy the website.

- Inkspace : To draw wireframe.

- [VsCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) : For code editing.

## Testing

------

The page used so many features to show to employers and recruiters what can be achieved by me.  The intention is to show of my work(s). 

In the about me section, they can read a bit about me, send me a message and download my CV. They are able to see my showcased projects via the project cards in the "Project" section. They can view the live version of my work by clicking on the Font Awesome icons. They are able to view my social media profiles via clicking on the icons in the contact area. They are also able to download my CV by either clicking on CV in the navbar or by clicking on the download arrow icon in the Contact section.

If you try to submit the contact form it won't work, it will be functional in the near future.

All links will open in a new tab using 'target="_blank"' and the CV will download  on click using the 'Download CV' or CV in the navbar. All links have been manually tested to ensure that they are working perfectly.

By clicking on the links in the navbar, the link will take you to the section named on the link. The link will glow green even on click or when you get to that section by scrolling down on the page, 

This site was tested across multiple browsers on multiple mobile devices to ensure compatibility and responsiveness. During the testing phase, I realized 
some device rendering the CSS in different ways. My Android phone aligned the project cards to the left. After many hours I started to test on other phones and tablets the cards were aligned perfectly . Except on my own device..

The HTML and CSS have been checked with W3 Validator both came out valid.

#### Conclusion : Test your pages with multiple dev tools and devices.

## Deployment

------

This site is hosted using GitHub pages and my own website.[GitHub Live](https://robibrutoczki.github.io/website/ "GitHub Live") and [RobbieB](http://robbieb.co.uk/ "RobbieB")

To run locally, you can clone this repository directly into your editor using git clone https://robibrutoczki.github.io/website/.

I used Visual Studio Code to write part of the code and used its terminal (Git) to send the files to GitHub.
